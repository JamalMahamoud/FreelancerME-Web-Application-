To avoid repetition of code most of the functionality are in the include folder.
All logins including admin are done through the same login page. If user is an admin
It will redirect to admin.php , if it is a customer  it will send user to jobpage.php.

After a sign up is done the admin can change the user role from default customer
to admin to give access to administration page, by editing the user. -->
